# Gracious Professionalism Keychain
You like robotics? You like Japanese (language)?
Help spread the spirit of FRC (or just FIRST in general)!

## Description
Designed in one day on onShape (on a Chromebook),
I made a keychain that says "gracious professionalism" in Japanese katakana:
「グレイシャス・プロフェッショナリズムのカタカナ」
Phonetically, you would say "Gureishyasu Purofesshonarizumu" which sounds pretty much the same

## Installation
Just download the file :) (look up a tutorial on spicing stl files though if you don't know how to 3D print)
I recommend what ever slicer that your local, nearby printer has.
Reputable ones are include Ultimaker Cura, Prusa Slicer, etc.

## Usage
It's a keychain; put it on your backpack, lanyard, necklace, car keys (it might bee to big though) or as a Christmas ornament! (if you actually do this that'd be so funny)

## Features
It has a hole for the rope of chain or whatever you use to keep the keychain connected
The Japanese letters are in katakana, and if you learn how to say the word, it'll roughly sound like the translation in English! (if you want to learn more, look up "what are loanwords in Japanese")

## Contributing
You can make your own version of it!
Feel free to send me another version of the print if you make one that's better tho
