# Gracious Professionalism Keychain
You like robotics? You like Japanese (language)?
Help spread the spirit of FRC (or just FIRST in general)!

## Description
A keychain that says "gracious professionalism" in Japanese katakana

## Installation
1. Just download the file :) (look up a tutorial on spicing stl files though if you don't know how to 3D print)

## Usage
It's a keychain; put it on your backpack, lanyard, necklace, car keys (it might bee to big though) or as a Christmas ornament! (if you actually do this that'd be so funny)

## Features
It has a hole for the rope of chain or whatever you use to keep the keychain connected
The Japanese letters are in katakana, and if you learn how to say the word, it'll roughly sound like the translation in English! (if you want to learn more, look up "what are loanwords in Japanese")
